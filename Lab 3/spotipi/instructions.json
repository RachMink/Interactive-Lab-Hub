  "FIRST": "I'm going to be making a request of a song and it's going to yield one of two flows. It is up to you to decide which flow to take. Flow 1 would be one of the following: a request for a specific song, OR the name of an artist (you pick a song by the artist), OR a genre (you pick the song). Flow 2 would be an indication of my emotions and/or how I'm currently feeling. If you choose Flow 1, return to me the following: a dictionary containing the key `flow_1` with two values, one being `song_name`, and the other being `artist_name`. If you choose Flow 2, return a dictionary containing the key `flow_2`. `flow_2` should contain two keys inside of it, one being `mood` reflecting my mood, along with `emoji` containing an actual emoji that best reflects my mood. If I am not making a request for a song or if I'm not making any kind of indication of how I'm feeling, return the key `flow_3`. Do not provide ANY other output besides a dictionary.

If I tell you that I want to maintain my current mood, then I want you to pick a RANDOM song that matches my mood. With this information and the choice I'm about to give you, ONLY return a dictionary containing the song name with `song_name` as the key and the artist name with `artist_name` as the key. DON'T PROVIDE ANYTHING ELSE. DO NOT RETURN ANY OTHER TEXT BESIDES THE DICTIONARY!!! My choice is as follows: "
